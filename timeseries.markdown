## Machine Learning Prediction Model for detecting danger zones for selected weather parameters correlated with wildfires

<p>In our machine learning prediction model we aimed to predict the critical threshold value which creates a zone for high danger for certain weather parameters(the ones which have at least low-moderate correlation with the wildfire incidents) which can cause an environment where high likelihood of wildfires can be expected for the future dates. We aimed to use these threshold values for certain weather parameter correlated with wildfires to create red danger zones for the future weather forecast data to predict the exact date and time when a there is possibly high likelihood and high risk-danger can be expected for wildfires to happen. We can later use that predicted time and date for possible wildfire occurences for the future, for protecting irreplaceable ecological zones and areas with fire prone vegetation which are shown in choropleth mapping in the end. </p>

With the threshold point that might trigger high possibility for wildfire occurances we generated red zones which are dangerous zones and if a weather parameter value goes inside the red zone, we can expect that the conditions might likely to allow wildfire to happen. We put future weather forecast to understand exact time and date where a weather parameter entered red zone to use that info to predict possible wildfires for the future for a location we know its weather conditions.
