# Introduction

Wildfires, historically a natural and integral part of many ecosystems, have been increasingly causing widespread destruction and are having a devastating impact on human settlements, economies and ecosystems alike. In Europe, this is particularly true in the Galicia region of Spain [Ref1](https://civio.es/en/spain-in-flames/forest-fires-map/), that have been identified as the most wildfire-prone area in Spain (see Figure 1).

Wildfires in Galicia are not merely coincidental - it is rooted in a combination of environmental, geographical and natural climatic factors. The regions hosts extensive forests, predominantly composed of highly flammable species such as pine and eucalyptus, and coupled with dry, rugged terrain the region has always been a hotbed for wildfire ignition and spread.

While natural factors have long influenced the wildfire regime in Galicia there have been an ever increasing rate of incidents - and the imprint of climate change is becoming increasingly evident. Rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns and periods of drought are currently being associated man-made climate change, which in turn are increasing the risk of wildfires (https://www.usgs.gov/science-explorer/climate/wildfire).

The combination of warmer and drier conditions not only prolongs the wildfire season in Galicia, but also enhances the likelihood of increased intensification of wildfires in the future (see Figure 2).

This project will explore the role and frequency of wildfires in the region based on both historic and current data from multiple sources. Weâ€™re aiming to increase awareness for both locals, tourists and policy-makers by combining important datasets that have so far been scattered, visualizing them together and using the data as a base for predicting future events using machine learning - effectively increasing ease of access, and allowing stakeholders to take actions based on informed decisions.
